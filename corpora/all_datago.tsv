30582655	Interestingly, ChIP-PCR and bisulphite pyrosequencing showed that E2F6 also epigenetically suppresses miR-193a, through recruitment of negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, and by a complex ceRNA mechanism in ovarian cancer cell lines.	negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II	GO_0000122	cancer	HP_0002664	
30582655	Importantly, cell line and animal experiments both confirmed that E2F6 promotes ovarian cancer stemness, whereas E2F6 or negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II depletion derepressed miR-193a, which opposes cancer stemness, by alleviating DNA methylation and repressive chromatin.	cancer	HP_0002664	negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II	GO_0000122
