28442722	In order to expand the mutation spectrum of the causative genes in Chinese adult population, we investigated three genes, SLC39A5, LEPREL1 and LRPAP1, in a cohort of 187 independent Chinese patients with high myopia.	SLC39A5	283375	LRPAP1	4043	myopia	HP_0000545	
28444220	While polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and phenotype of more *conventional* ataxias.	ataxia	HP_0001251	ATXN1	6310	ATXN2	6311	ATXN3	4287	ATXN7	6314	CACNA1A	773	TBP	6908	
28444220	Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001).	ataxia	HP_0001251	SPG7	6687	
28444220	Similar differences were found among a single gene group, comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the disease.	CACNA1A	773	ataxia	HP_0001251	
28444220	In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes.	ataxia	HP_0001251	CACNA1A	773	SPG7	6687

28453180	VPS45-associated severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare disorder characterized by life-threating infections, neutropenia, neutrophil and platelet dysfunction, poor response to filgrastim, and myelofibrosis with extramedullary hematopoiesis.	VPS45	11311	neutropenia	HP_0001875	
28459465	Here, we report that the expression of the INTU gene is aberrantly elevated in human basal cell carcinoma (BCC), coinciding with increased primary cilia formation and activated hedgehog (Hh) signaling.	INTU	27152	basal cell carcinoma	HP_0002671	
28467418	Our results therefore confirm the KCNC3R423H allele as causative for SCA13, through a dominant negative effect on KCNC3WT and links with EGFR that account for dominant inheritance, congenital onset, and disease pathology	KCNC3	3748	EGFR	1956	inheritance	HP_0000005	
28475127	The up-regulation of ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 1q (AF1q) is commonly seen in aggressive hematologic malignancies as well as in several solid tumor tissues.	AF1q	10962	tumor	HP_0002664	
28475127	Clinical specimens revealed that AF1q was up-regulated in human CRC tissues, and that this up-regulation was associated with tumor metastasis and late tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) stage.	AF1q	10962	tumor	HP_0002664	
28475127	AF1q knockdown by shRNA inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro, as well as tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in vivo, whereas these effects were reversed following AF1q overexpression.	AF1q	10962	tumor	HP_0002664	
28475127	These AF1q-mediated effects were modulated by the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, and inhibition of AKT signaling attenuated AF1q-induced tumor promotion.	AF1q	10962	tumor	HP_0002664	
28475127	Thus, AF1q contributes to CRC tumorigenesis and progression through the activation of the AKT signaling pathway.	AF1q	10962	tumor	HP_0002664	
28475863	In a multiplex consanguineous Saudi family affected by severe and recurrent large joint dislocation and severe myopia, we identified a homozygous truncating variant in GZF1 through a combined autozygome and exome approach.	myopia	HP_0000545	GZF1	64412	
28475863	Independently, the same approach identified a second homozygous truncating GZF1 variant in another multiplex consanguineous family affected by severe myopia, retinal detachment, and milder skeletal involvement.	GZF1	64412	myopia	HP_0000545	retinal detachment	HP_0000541

28501528	Mechanistically, BCKDK promotes colorectal cancer by enhancing the MAPK signaling pathway through direct MEK phosphorylation, rather than by branched-chain amino acids catabolism.	BCKDK	10295	cancer	HP_0002664	
28501528	Here we investigated that abnormal branched-chain amino acids catabolism in colorectal cancer is a result of the disease process, with no role in disease initiation; BCKDK is widely expressed in colorectal cancer patients, and those patients that express higher levels of BCKDK have shorter survival times than those with lower levels; BCKDK promotes cell transformation or colorectal cancer ex vivo or in vivo.	cancer	HP_0002664	BCKDK	10295	
28503860	ADAMTS18 dysregulation plays an important role in many disease processes including cancer.	ADAMTS18	170692	cancer	HP_0002664	
28503860	We previously found ADAMTS18 as frequently methylated tumor suppressor gene (TSG) for multiple carcinomas, however, its biological functions and underlying molecular mechanisms in breast carcinogenesis remain unknown.	ADAMTS18	170692	tumor	HP_0002664	
28503860	Here, we found that ADAMTS18 was silenced or downregulated in breast cancer cell lines.	ADAMTS18	170692	cancer	HP_0002664	
28503860	ADAMTS18 was reduced in primary breast tumor tissues as compared with their adjacent noncancer tissues.	ADAMTS18	170692	tumor	HP_0002664	cancer	HP_0002664	
28503860	ADAMTS18 promoter methylation was detected in 70.8% of tumor tissues by methylation-specific PCR, but none of the normal tissues.	ADAMTS18	170692	tumor	HP_0002664	
28503860	Ectopic expression of ADAMTS18 in breast tumor cells resulted in inhibition of cell migration and invasion.	ADAMTS18	170692	tumor	HP_0002664	
28503860	Nude mouse model further confirmed that ADAMTS18 suppressed breast cancer metastasis in vivo.	ADAMTS18	170692	cancer	HP_0002664	
28503860	Further mechanistic studies showed that ADAMTS18 suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), further inhibited migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.	ADAMTS18	170692	cancer	HP_0002664	
28503860	Thus, ADAMTS18 as an antimetastatic tumor suppressor antagonizes AKT and NF-kB signaling in breast tumorigenesis.	ADAMTS18	170692	tumor	HP_0002664	NF	23114

28515149	Here, we assessed whether disrupting pyruvate kinase-M (Pkm), an enzyme that acts in the terminal steps of glycolysis, would alter CGNP metabolism, proliferation, and tumorigenesis.	Pkm	5315	tumor	HP_0002664	
28515149	We observed a dichotomous pattern of PKM expression, in which postmitotic neurons throughout the brain expressed the constitutively active PKM1 isoform, while neural progenitors and medulloblastomas exclusively expressed the less active PKM2.	PKM	5315	medulloblastoma	HP_0002885

28525318	Gastric tumor tissues and paired adjacent non-tumor tissues were obtained from 21 gastric cancer patients, and gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, MGC-803, KATO-III, MKN-45, SGC-7901, BGC-823 and MKN-74) were cultured.	tumor	HP_0002664	cancer	HP_0002664	SGC	6443	
28525318	The results indicated that compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues and a normal gastric epithelial cell line, gastric cancer tissues and cell lines exhibited significantly higher expression of CUL4B.	tumor	HP_0002664	cancer	HP_0002664	CUL4B	8450	
28525318	Knockdown of CUL4B in gastric cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation, caused G1 arrest and inhibited cell invasion.	CUL4B	8450	cancer	HP_0002664	
28525318	These results indirectly demonstrate that CUL4B enhances the proliferation and invasion abilities of gastric cancer cells by upregulating the constituent factors Wnt and b-catenin, as well as by negatively regulating the mRNA and protein expression of GSK-3b, caspase-3 and cyclin E.

29307819	The use of low fidelity DNA polymerases in the translesional synthesis (TLS) DNA damage response pathway that repairs lesions caused by cisplatin also presents a mutational carcinogenic burden on cells that needs to be regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53.	tumor	HP_0002664	p53	7157	
29307819	However, there is much debate over the roles of the reversionless 3-like (REV3L) protein responsible for TLS and p53 in regulating cancer cell metabolism.	REV3L	5980	cancer	HP_0002664	
29307819	In this study, the fluorescence lifetime of the metabolic coenzyme NADH reveals that the absence of REV3L can promote the p53-mediated upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in cisplatin-treated H1299 lung carcinoma cells and increases cancer cell sensitivity to this platinum-based chemotherapy.

29843367	Our aim was to understand the role of RNASEH2A in cancer prognostication and to establish a scoring system based on the expressions of genes interacting with RNASEH2A.	RNASEH2A	10535	cancer	HP_0002664	
29843367	We screened the nucleotide degrading enzyme gene expression in RNAseq data of 14 cancer types derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found that RNASEH2A overexpression was associated with poor patient survival only in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs).	cancer	HP_0002664	RNASEH2A	10535	
29843367	The combination of low CD151 expression and high RNASEH2A expression resulted in impaired proliferation in four kidney cancer cell lines, suggesting potential synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) interactions between the two genes.	CD151	977	RNASEH2A	10535	cancer	HP_0002664

29844165	PEPCK-M (PCK2), the mitochondrial isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), has been shown by us and others to be functionally expressed and to mediate gluconeogenesis, the reverse pathway of glycolysis, in different cancer cells.	PEPCK	5106	PCK2	5106	cancer	HP_0002664	
29844165	Serine and ribose synthesis have been identified as downstream pathways fed by PEPCK in cancer cells.	PEPCK	5106	cancer	HP_0002664	
29844165	This pathway is required to maintain levels of GPL, especially phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), as shown by stable shRNA-mediated silencing of PEPCK-M in H23 lung cancer cells.	PEPCK	5106	cancer	HP_0002664

30125135	Unlike patients with ECTD-9, Hoxc13-mutated mice and pigs do not faithfully recapitulate the phenotype of hypotrichosis, so there is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of Hoxc13-mediated hypotrichosis in animal models and clinically.
