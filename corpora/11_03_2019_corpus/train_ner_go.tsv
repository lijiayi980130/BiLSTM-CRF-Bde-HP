30582655	To decipher a mechanism for this, we previously generated a mathematical model of how estrogen-mediated upregulation of the transcription factor, E2F6, upregulates the ovarian cancer stem/initiating cell marker, activation of MAPK activity, by epigenetic silencing the tumor suppressor miR-193a, and a competing endogenous (ceRNA) mechanism.	cancer	HP_0002664	activation of MAPK activity	GO_0000187	tumor	HP_0002664	
30582655	Interestingly, ChIP-PCR and bisulphite pyrosequencing showed that E2F6 also epigenetically suppresses miR-193a, through recruitment of negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, and by a complex ceRNA mechanism in ovarian cancer cell lines.	negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II	GO_0000122	cancer	HP_0002664	
30582655	Importantly, cell line and animal experiments both confirmed that E2F6 promotes ovarian cancer stemness, whereas E2F6 or negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II depletion derepressed miR-193a, which opposes cancer stemness, by alleviating DNA methylation and repressive chromatin.	cancer	HP_0002664	negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II	GO_0000122
