27607025	As a reason why the present case showed lethal phenotype despite the in-frame deletion mutation, rapid degradation of neo-synthesized α6 protein and/or impaired transport of integrin were suggested from previous reports, and the lack of localization of integrin α6β4 to the epidermal basement membrane resulted in skin fragility.	type	6445	skin fragility	HP_0001030

28650469	Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling at primary cilia drives the proliferation and progression of a subset of medulloblastomas, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumor.	SHH	6469	medulloblastomas	HP_0002885	tumor	HP_0002664	
28650469	However, the role INPP5E plays in cancer is unknown and the contribution of PI3-kinase signaling to cilia function is little characterized.	INPP5E	23203	cancer	HP_0002664	PI3	5266	
28650469	Here, we reveal INPP5E promotes SHH signaling in SHH medulloblastoma by negatively regulating a cilia-compartmentalized PI3-kinase signaling axis that maintains primary cilia on tumor cells.	INPP5E	23203	SHH	6469	medulloblastoma	HP_0002885	PI3	5266	tumor	HP_0002664	
28650469	Conditional deletion of Inpp5e in a murine model of constitutively active Smoothened-driven medulloblastoma slowed tumor progression, suppressed cell proliferation, reduced SHH signaling and promoted tumor cell cilia loss.	Inpp5e	23203	medulloblastoma	HP_0002885	tumor	HP_0002664	SHH	6469	
28650469	The number of PtdIns(3,4,5)Psub3/sub/pAKT/pGSK3β-positive cilia was increased in cultured Inpp5e-null tumor cells relative to controls.	Inpp5e	23203	tumor	HP_0002664

29103025	We have identified nine genes of interest that appear to be involved in cervical cancer development: SPARCL1, SYCP2, KIF4A, PRC1, TOP2A, LAMP3, KIF20A, MCM2, and APOBEC3B.	cancer	HP_0002664	SPARCL1	8404	SYCP2	10388	KIF4A	24137	PRC1	9055	TOP2A	7153	LAMP3	27074	KIF20A	10112	MCM2	4176	
29103025	Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and co-expression analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that SPARCL1 may play a core role in cervical cancer development.	SPARCL1	8404	cancer	HP_0002664	
29103025	Further, we analyzed the expression of these nine genes during the progression of cervical cancer, and found that SPARCL1 is also related to precancerous lesions and migration processes during cervical cancer pathogenesis.	cancer	HP_0002664	SPARCL1	8404	
29103025	Finally, we validated these observations by investigating SPARCL1 expression in cervical cancer tissue and serum samples.	SPARCL1	8404	cancer	HP_0002664	
29103025	The diagnostic specificity of serum SPARCL1 in cervical cancer occurrence was also compared with other high incidence diseases.	SPARCL1	8404	cancer	HP_0002664

29348457	By using three human tumor cell lines of different tissue origin (epidermoid HEp-3 and prostate PC-3 carcinomas and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma) and several metastasis models conducted in both mammalian and avian settings, we show that LTBP3 is involved in the early dissemination of primary cancer cells, namely in the intravasation step of the metastatic cascade.	tumor	HP_0002664	carcinomas	HP_0030731	fibrosarcoma	HP_0100244	LTBP3	4054	cancer	HP_0002664	step	84867	
29348457	Knockdown of LTBP3 in all tested cell lines led to significant inhibition of tumor cell intravasation, but did not affect primary tumor growth.	LTBP3	4054	tumor	HP_0002664

29348457	A similar compensatory approach rescued the dampened intravasation of LTBP3-deficient HEp-3 cells, suggesting that LTBP3 regulates the induction of the intravasation-supporting angiogenic vasculature within developing primary tumors.	LTBP3	4054	tumor	HP_0002664	
29348457	Using our recently developed microtumor model, we confirmed that LTBP3 loss resulted in the development of intratumoral vessels with an abnormal microarchitecture incompatible with efficient intravasation of HEp-3 carcinoma cells.	tumor	HP_0002664	LTBP3	4054

29445180	Here, we determine that non-canonical IKKα-RelB pathway activation of KRAS-mutant tumor cells mediates MPE development and this is fueled by host-provided interleukin IL-1β.	RelB	5971	KRAS	3845	tumor	HP_0002664

30125135	Unlike patients with ECTD-9, Hoxc13-mutated mice and pigs do not faithfully recapitulate the phenotype of hypotrichosis, so there is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of Hoxc13-mediated hypotrichosis in animal models and clinically.

30125135	In addition, reduced hair follicles (HFs) while the enlarged and increased number of sebaceous glands (SGs) were also found in the Hoxc13sup-/-/sup rabbits, showing that the disrupted balance between HFs and SGs may respond to hypotrichosis of ECTD-9 in an animal model and clinically.

30128822	However, mechanistic aspects by which NRF1 may contribute to susceptibility to different breast tumor subtypes are still not fully understood.	NRF1	4779	tumor	HP_0002664	
30128822	Since transcriptional control of NRF1 seems to be dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, herein, we investigated the role of NRF1 in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor negative, but human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (ER/PR -ve HER2 +ve) breast cancer.	NRF1	4779	HER2	2064	cancer	HP_0002664	
30128822	We found that both mRNA and protein levels of NRF1 and its transcriptional activity were significantly higher in ER/PR -ve HER2 +ve breast cancer samples compared to normal breast tissues.	NRF1	4779	HER2	2064	cancer	HP_0002664	
30128822	This was consistent with our observation of higher NRF1 protein expression in the experimental model of HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis.	NRF1	4779	HER2	2064	cancer	HP_0002664	
30128822	To identify network-based pathways involved in the susceptibility to the ER/PR -ve HER2 +ve breast cancer subtype, the NRF1 transcriptional regulatory genome-wide landscape was analyzed using the approach consisting of a systematic integration of ChIP DNA-seq, RNA-Microarray, NRF1 protein-DNA motif binding, signal pathway analysis, and Bayesian machine learning.	HER2	2064	cancer	HP_0002664	NRF1	4779	ChIP	10273	
30128822	Our findings show that a high percentage of known HER2+ breast cancer susceptibility genes, including EGFR, IGFR, and E2F1, are under transcriptional control of NRF1.	HER2	2064	cancer	HP_0002664	EGFR	1956	IGFR	3480	E2F1	1869	NRF1	4779	
30128822	Promoters of several genes from the KEGG HER2+ breast cancer pathway and 11 signaling pathways linked to 6 hallmarks of cancer contain the NRF1 motif.	HER2	2064	cancer	HP_0002664	NRF1	4779

30128822	In addition, we found using Bayesian network-based machine learning that 30 NRF1 motif-enriched genes including growth factor receptors-FGFR1, IGF1R; E2Fs transcription factor family-E2F1, E2F3; MAPK pathway-SHC2, GRB2, MAPK1; PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway-PIK3CD, PIK3R1, PIK3R3, RPS6KB2; WNT signaling pathway-WNT7B, DLV1, DLV2, GSK3B, NRF1, and DDB2, known for its role in DNA repair and involvement in early events associated with metastatic progression of breast cancer cells, were associated with HER2-amplified breast cancer.

30128822	Machine learning search further revealed that the likelihood of HER2-positive breast cancer is almost 100% in a patient with the high NRF1 expression combined with expression patterns of high E2F3, GSK3B, and MAPK1, low or no change in E2F1 and FGFR1, and high or no change in PIK3R3.

30128822	Clinical confirmation of our machine learned Bayesian networks will have significant impact on our understanding of the role of NRF1 as a valuable biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis as well as provide strong rationale for future studies to develop NRF1 signaling-based therapeutics to target HER2+ breast cancer	NRF1	4779	cancer	HP_0002664	HER2	2064

30582655	To decipher a mechanism for this, we previously generated a mathematical model of how estrogen-mediated upregulation of the transcription factor, E2F6, upregulates the ovarian cancer stem/initiating cell marker, c-Kit, by epigenetic silencing the tumor suppressor miR-193a, and a competing endogenous (ceRNA) mechanism.	cancer	HP_0002664	c-Kit	3815	tumor	HP_0002664
